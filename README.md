## 📝 Project Overview  
In today's digital world, **data security and privacy** are top priorities. Traditional encryption methods are often detectable, making them vulnerable to interception.  

This project solves that challenge by using **steganography**—a technique that **hides secret messages inside images** without altering their appearance.  

> 📌 **Think of it as writing a secret message in invisible ink—but inside a digital image!**  

## 🚀 Features (Wow Factor)  
✔ **Advanced LSB Steganography** – Uses **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** method to embed messages into images securely.  
✔ **Passcode Protection** – Only users with the correct passcode can retrieve hidden data.  
✔ **Lossless PNG Format** – Ensures image quality is not compromised while preserving hidden data integrity.  
✔ **User-Friendly GUI** – Built with **Tkinter**, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages effortlessly.  
✔ **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Works on **Windows & Linux**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
🔹 **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
🔹 **Libraries:**  
   - `OpenCV` – For image processing  
   - `NumPy` – For efficient array manipulation  
   - `Tkinter` (with ttk) – For a modern and interactive GUI  
🔹 **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows/Linux)  
🔹 **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code  

## 🎯 Target Users  
This project is designed for:  
✅ **Security Professionals & Cybersecurity Enthusiasts** – To enhance secure communication.  
✅ **Journalists, Activists & Government Agencies** – To protect sensitive information.  
✅ **Students & Researchers** – To learn and experiment with steganography techniques.  
✅ **General Users** – To keep their data hidden without raising suspicion.  

## 📸 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Encryption Process:**  
   - The user enters a secret message and a passcode.  
   - The algorithm converts the text into binary and embeds it into an image using the **LSB technique**.  
   - The modified image is saved without any visible changes.  

2️⃣ **Decryption Process:**  
   - The receiver loads the modified image and enters the correct passcode.  
   - The hidden message is extracted and displayed.  

### 🔧 Installation & Usage
